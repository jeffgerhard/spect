# spect

This is the website/blog generator running my personal website. I intend to flesh
it out so that it can ultimately be used by other people, but it's still very
much in alpha development.

I introduced this project in a set of three blog posts: [1](http://jeffgerhard.com/blog/2016-12-31--stuck-outside-of-facebook/), [2](http://jeffgerhard.com/blog/2017-01-10--writing-code-to-make/), [3](http://jeffgerhard.com/blog/2017-01-17--great-ex-spect-ations/).

Check out the [road map](roadmap.md) for more details.
