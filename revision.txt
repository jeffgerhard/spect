code restructure plan for spect system:

admin --> functioning. may still be expanded later.

-spect [updates everything; generates files] --> note that i need some ways to run this for debug purposes so i don't keep regenerating everything while experimenting with code
-spectml [html tools]
-remotetils [uploads and downloads] (maybe not though)
-imgutils
-videoutils?
-newpost [creates a markdown; optionally builds the thing entire like for tumblr-style posts]
-admin [run various administrative tasks]
-template building?

-sitemap
-rss
-json

separate(?) module for css work? would like to at least automate sassc part; can also minify easily i imagine

THINK ABOUT CLASSES; LIKE FOR ALL THESE VARIOUS DICTIONARIES  // DRY

like a Spect() class
spectposts = Spect()
spectposts.tags could be return the function of the tags
spectposts.catsdict()
spectposts.name could be 'Spect'
monodroneposts.name could be 'ARCHIVE of monodrone.org'
monodroneposts.type could be 'archive'
tumbrlposts.tags
spectposts.update()
spectposts.
